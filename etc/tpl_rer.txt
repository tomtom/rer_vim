    - Send code to R via |rescreen.txt| (<C-CR>, <C-S-CR>, gx operator)
    - 'omnifunc' completion (|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-O|; works also for function 
      arguments)
    - Use |K| to display informatin on an identifier
    - Source the current buffer (nmap: gxrs)
    - Debug/Undebug a function (n/vmap: gxrd)
    - Display function arguments (n/vmap: gxrf)
    - Show a summary for the word under cursor (nmap: gxrm)
    - Show examples for the word under cursor (nmap: gxre)
    - Run an R function on the word under cursor (nmap: gxrd)
    - Experimental: Set/unset breakpoints (nmap: gxrb)
    - |:Rer| command to send code to R
    - |:Rcd| command to set R working directory to the current buffer 
      (nmap: gxrcd)

The map prefix (gx) is user-configurable via |g:rer#mapleader|.

This plugin was tested on Linux (Ubuntu) & Windows. On Windows, this plugin 
assumes the use of the native Windows version of R (or rather Rterm) and of 
the Cygwin port of the screen utility.

Certain functions make use of the tlib vim plugin (vimscript #1863) if
